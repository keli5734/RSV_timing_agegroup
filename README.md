In short, we used a statistical model to estimate how much RSV spreads within the same age group versus between different age groups. The model looks at the number of hospitalizations over time and considers factors like past cases in the same or other age groups, seasonal patterns, and holiday periods (Christmas, Thanksgiving, and school breaks). 

It also accounts for differences in how cases are reported across age groups and states. The model was tested in different forms, and the version we used was the best fit based on a standard evaluation method.
